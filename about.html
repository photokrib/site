            <h1>about</h1>
            <p>
                Karthik Kribakaran (b. 1996, Mountain View, California) is a contemporary photographer
                based in San Fransisco, California.
            </p>
            <p>
                His interest in photography came from the desire to express feelings or emotions that
                language can fail to capture. His 'dictionary' project is an attempt to explore gaps in
                the English language filled by words from other languages -- an attempt to learn and
                evoke those words through photography.
